Results:

	- predicting field 2, diagnosis: B = benign, M = malignant
	- sets are linearly separable using all 30 input features
	- best predictive accuracy obtained using one separating plane
		in the 3-D space of Worst Area, Worst Smoothness and
		Mean Texture.  Estimated accuracy 97.5% using repeated
		10-fold crossvalidations.  Classifier has correctly
		diagnosed 176 consecutive new patients as of November
		1995. 

4. Relevant information

	Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle
	aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe
	characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
	A few of the images can be found at
	http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~street/images/

	Separating plane described above was obtained using
	Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree
	Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th
	Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society,
	pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear
	programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features
	were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4
	features and 1-3 separating planes.

	The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane
	in the 3-dimensional space is that described in:
	[K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear
	Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets",
	Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

5. Number of instances: 569 

6. Number of attributes: 32 (ID, diagnosis, 30 real-valued input features)

7. Attribute information

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

	a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
	b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
	c) perimeter
	d) area
	e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
	f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
	g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
	h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
	i) symmetry 
	j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

Several of the papers listed above contain detailed descriptions of
how these features are computed. 

The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.

8. Missing attribute values: none

9. Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
